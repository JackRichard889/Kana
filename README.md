# Kana

Kana is a multiplatform library for graphics development. Harnessing the power of OpenGL ES and the Apple Metal API, Kana makes multiplatform graphics possible through the use of a common framework and Kotlin/Native.

The library is intended to be used in a multiplatform application through Jitpack.
